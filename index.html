    <div class="container paragraph paragraphMain">
        <p>This site serves as a portfolio website for HalValla. You will find tech projects (github links), art showcases (usually artstation) and music (soundcloud / spotify). The page is still in early development, and will be periodically updated. Stay tuned!</p>
        <p>I have a wide range of competence across music, art and coding. I have studied at music school as well as private lessons. In addition, I've studied 3D art and games technology at Noroff University College, and I'm self taught in the programming realm, other than blueprinting in the Unreal Engine</p>

            <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>Art can be anything – video games, movies, paintings, metalwork, carpentry, even macaroni figures. What I like about art is that it defies a singular definition, offering infinite interpretations across various mediums. This diversity in expression shows that creativity knows no bounds, allowing individuals to convey their emotions, stories, or perspectives in ways that resonate with them. Whether it's through digital realms or handcrafted objects, each form of art reflects a unique blend of imagination and skill. </p>
            <p>
                What makes art truly fascinating is its abstract nature, despite its tangible manifestations. While there may not be a strict definition of what qualifies as art, we instinctively recognize it as something that can be experienced physically—whether through sight, sound, or touch. This ability to transform abstract ideas into concrete forms bridges the gap between the intangible and the sensory, giving us a way to interpret and interact with the world around us. Art allows us to see beyond the ordinary, elevating everyday experiences into something extraordinary.

            <h3>Music (my absolute passion)</h3>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a child, music has had a special place in my heart. My father still has a video on his computer of a (very) young me playing the intro melody to the Pinchcliffe movie on a little toy keyboard we had. When I was 12, I started taking private piano lessons, and I quickly found my path - at least for the teenage years. I became the "piano guy" at my school. Not long after, I started playing more instruments, producing music on a friend's FL Studio license, and I was in awe of what I could do without an actual instrument in the room. I have since changed to Cubase Pro, and have done some music gigs in the past.

                One of the things regarding music that I've really enjoyed doing is so-called "Russemusikk" - a norwegian genre of music specifically tailored towards partying high school graduates. The "russetid" is a period, usually about a month, where graduates dress up in "russedress" every day, they party, hand out "russ cards" and a all in all a bunch of fun. Some groups also has tailor made songs specifically for said group - that's where I came in. In Norway, I am to a handful of people known as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3WlFhvwLbSLC03nEQNg8Qc">Mobergen.</a> Eventually I started producing orchestral music, which lead me to compose the music for an <a href="https://youtu.be/Xeyl15_4n8w?si=5zItLHk_yka1NBC5">asset showcase for the Gods of Asgard game</a> (which has since been scrapped).
