    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This site serves as a portfolio website for HalValla. You will find coding projects (github links), art showcases (usually artstation) and music (soundcloud/spotify). The page is still in early development, and will be periodically updated. Stay tuned!</p>
        <p>I have a wide range of competence across music, art and coding. I have studied at music school as well as private lessons. In addition, I've studied 3D art and games technology at Noroff University College, and I'm self taught in the programming realm, other than blueprinting in the Unreal Engine</p>
